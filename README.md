# University Projects
This is a collation of all the coding projects that I have completed while studying for my bachelors in Mathematical Sciences from the University of Bath

## What I have done

# MATLAB Recursion (Semester 2 2017/18)
This was my first foray into MATLAB and recursion - not massively complex or lengthy code, but I learnt how a computer efficiently would calculate exponentials or polynomials.

I also learnt the importance of writing and running unit tests to ensure that ones code meets all base and edge cases.


# Realistic Raytracer (Semester 1 2020/21)
I created from the ground up a 3D renderer that can render 3D objects (given by a collection of vertices to form triangles) and applies lighting; both natural lighting and that from light objects.

This was my introduction to C++, where I learnt basics of reading files and solidified my understanding of OOP. It gave me an excellent understanding of vector calculations, as I had to create efficient code for raycasting against multiple objects (3D Meshes alongside more geometric objects e.g. 3D Planes, Spheres, Cuboids..)
